        </header>

        <section class="prose">
          <p>When systems fail you, you learn to file complaints. You document. You follow procedures. You believe—or try to—that oversight mechanisms exist to hold institutions accountable when they behave badly.</p>

          <p>And then you watch those mechanisms fail too.</p>

          <p>After my termination from PPG, I filed a disability discrimination complaint with the Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations. The process was exactly what you'd expect: formal documentation, sworn statements, evidence submission, investigative procedures. The commission requested a position statement from PPG explaining their rationale for my termination. PPG provided their version of events. I submitted a rebuttal.</p>

          <p>And in that exchange, something remarkable happened.</p>

          <p>PPG's position statement contained claims that were demonstrably false. They stated my position had not been replaced. But I had documentation showing it was—the job posting that appeared on the day of my termination, my LinkedIn post documenting the outsourcing, communications with former colleagues confirming the position was filled in Poland.</p>

          <p>This wasn't a matter of interpretation or differing perspectives. It was a factual claim that contradicted available evidence. The kind of misrepresentation that, in theory, should trigger consequences.</p>

          <p>But here's what I learned: there are no consequences for <span class="redacted">lying</span> to oversight agencies. Not really.</p>

          <h3>The Mechanics of Bureaucratic Gaslighting</h3>

          <p>Human relations commissions and equal employment opportunity agencies serve a critical function. They provide a venue for discrimination complaints outside the court system. They investigate allegations. They can issue findings of probable cause. They're supposed to level the playing field between individual workers and corporate legal departments.</p>

          <p>But they operate with limited resources and constrained authority. Most commissions can't compel testimony. They can't force document production beyond what parties voluntarily provide. They rely heavily on the honesty of respondents' position statements.</p>

          <p>And when respondents <span class="redacted">lie</span>? The consequences are minimal.</p>

          <p>In legal proceedings, making false statements under oath is perjury—a crime with serious consequences. But position statements to administrative agencies aren't given under oath. They're signed by company representatives who are ethically and legally obligated to be truthful, but the enforcement of that obligation is weak.</p>

          <p>If you can prove a company <span class="redacted">lied</span> in their position statement, what happens? Maybe the commission notes it in their investigation file. Maybe it influences their finding. Maybe it doesn't. There's no penalty. No sanction. No professional consequence for the attorney who signed the false statement. No reputational damage for the company.</p>

          <p>This creates perverse incentives. Companies can calculate that being dishonest in their position statement is low-risk. If the complainant can't definitively prove the falsehood, it goes unchallenged. If the complainant can prove it, the worst-case outcome is that the commission doesn't believe that particular claim—but the company still faces no penalty for the dishonesty itself.</p>

          <p>So why tell the truth?</p>

          <p>In PPG's case, denying that my position was replaced served a clear purpose. If they'd acknowledged outsourcing the role, it would undermine their cost-reduction narrative. It would raise questions about why the work was necessary enough to fill but not necessary enough to retain the existing worker. It would make the termination look more like replacement than elimination.</p>

          <p>By flatly denying the replacement, they simplified their defense. And because I'd already signed a severance agreement waiving my right to financial remedies, the commission's investigation was largely academic. Even if they found probable cause of discrimination, I couldn't receive compensation. The most I could achieve was a formal finding—which might matter for public record but wouldn't address the material harm.</p>

          <p>The company's legal team knew all this. They knew the limited consequences of misrepresentation. They knew the asymmetry between their resources and mine. They knew the system was structured in ways that let them shape the narrative with minimal accountability.</p>

          <p>And so they <span class="redacted">lied</span>.</p>

          <h3>The Evidence That Doesn't Matter</h3>

          <p>The commission can consider my evidence in evaluating PPG's credibility. They can note the contradiction in their findings. But they can't sanction PPG for <span class="redacted">lying</span>. They can't refer the matter to the Pennsylvania bar for ethical violations. They can't even make the dishonesty a matter of public record in a way that would damage the company's reputation.</p>

          <p>The most that happens is that the commission's investigator privately knows the company <span class="redacted">lied</span>. And that knowledge has no teeth.</p>

          <p>This is bureaucratic gaslighting. The system asks you to document your claims, submit evidence, tell your truth. And then it allows the institution with vastly greater resources to contradict your evidence with no meaningful consequences for dishonesty.</p>

          <p>The message it sends is clear: your evidence doesn't actually matter. The institution's narrative will prevail regardless of its relationship to truth. And the procedural fairness you thought the system provided is mostly theater.</p>

          <h3>The Broader Pattern</h3>

          <p>This isn't unique to my case or to PPG. It's a structural feature of how administrative oversight works in employment disputes.</p>

          <p>Companies respond to discrimination complaints with position statements drafted by lawyers who understand exactly how much truth-shading they can get away with. They know which claims can be verified and which can't. They know that administrative agencies have limited investigative resources. They know that most complainants lack the documentation to definitively contradict corporate narratives.</p>

          <p>And they know that even when caught in outright falsehoods, the consequences are minimal.</p>

          <p>Some will argue that this is just the reality of adversarial systems. Each side presents the best case they can. Truth emerges through the collision of competing narratives. That's how legal proceedings work.</p>

          <p>But administrative complaint processes aren't supposed to be fully adversarial. They're supposed to be investigative. The agency is meant to find facts, not just arbitrate between competing claims. And fact-finding requires that parties provide truthful information. When they don't, and there are no consequences, the process breaks down.</p>

          <p>The imbalance is staggering. Individual complainants typically provide information under penalty of perjury or at least with the understanding that false statements could harm their case. Companies provide information through lawyers who've carefully calibrated their statements to minimize risk while maximizing defensive value. The standards aren't the same.</p>

          <p>And because most discrimination complaints don't result in litigation—because most complainants accept unfavorable findings or settle quietly—the misrepresentations in position statements never get tested in formal discovery. The <span class="redacted">lies</span> work. The companies face no consequences. And the next time a complaint arrives, they do it again.</p>

          <h3>What Accountability Would Look Like</h3>

          <p>If administrative complaint processes are going to function as meaningful oversight mechanisms, they need teeth. That would require several changes.</p>

          <p>First, verification under oath. Position statements should be sworn testimony, subject to perjury penalties. This would raise the stakes for dishonesty and make company representatives think twice before including demonstrably false claims.</p>

          <p>Second, limited discovery authority. Agencies should have power to compel document production in cases where position statements are contradicted by available evidence. If a complainant provides documentation showing a position was replaced, and the company denies it, the agency should be able to request internal hiring records to verify the truth.</p>

          <p>Third, sanctions for misrepresentation. When agencies discover that a respondent made false statements, there should be consequences. Fines. Public disclosure. Referrals to state bars for attorney misconduct. Something that creates real incentive for honesty.</p>

          <p>Fourth, published findings. Even when complaints don't result in legal remedies, the findings should be publicly accessible. Companies that repeatedly provide misleading position statements should have that pattern visible to future complainants, oversight bodies, and the public.</p>

          <p>Fifth, protected retaliation reporting. Complainants who experience retaliation—like being informally blacklisted from internal job applications, as I suspected happened—should have clear channels to report that without fear of further harm. And agencies should have authority to investigate such claims independently.</p>

          <p>None of this is radical. It's basic procedural fairness. But it would require funding administrative agencies adequately, empowering them to actually investigate rather than just process paperwork, and creating real consequences for institutional dishonesty.</p>

          <p>We're nowhere near that point.</p>

          <h3>The Illusion of Recourse</h3>

          <p>The existence of administrative complaint processes creates an illusion of accountability. Workers who've been treated poorly are told: file a complaint. Use the system. That's what it's there for.</p>

          <p>And so they do. They invest time documenting their cases. They submit evidence. They write detailed narratives of what happened. They hope that the system will vindicate them, or at least acknowledge that they were wronged.</p>

          <p>Then they encounter the reality. The agency sends the company a notice. The company's lawyer drafts a position statement that presents the most favorable narrative possible, unconstrained by strict truthfulness requirements. The complainant submits a rebuttal. The agency reviews the materials and issues a finding.</p>

          <p>In the vast majority of cases, that finding is "no probable cause." Not because the complainant's allegations are false, but because meeting the evidentiary standard for discrimination is extremely difficult. Especially when the respondent can shape the narrative without meaningful accountability for dishonesty.</p>

          <p>Even when agencies do find probable cause, the remedies are limited. In my case, because I'd signed a severance release, the most the commission could do was issue a finding. No reinstatement. No compensation. Just a formal acknowledgment that discrimination may have occurred.</p>

          <p>So what does the complaint process actually accomplish? It creates documentation. It lets complainants feel like they tried. It allows agencies to process cases and issue findings. It maintains the appearance of oversight.</p>

          <p>But for many complainants, it doesn't deliver justice. It doesn't change corporate behavior. And it doesn't prevent the same patterns from recurring.</p>

          <p>This doesn't mean filing complaints is pointless. In some cases—particularly egregious discrimination with strong documentation—the process can lead to meaningful remedies. And even when it doesn't, creating a formal record can matter for establishing patterns if multiple complaints accumulate.</p>

          <p>But we should be honest about what the process typically delivers: not accountability, but the appearance of accountability. Not justice, but the illusion of recourse.</p>

          <h3>The Long-Term Consequence</h3>

          <p>When companies face no consequences for dishonesty in complaint processes, they learn that <span class="redacted">lying</span> works. They learn that they can deny easily-verified facts and suffer no penalties. They learn that administrative agencies lack the resources and authority to meaningfully challenge corporate narratives.</p>

          <p>This corrupts the entire system. If respondents can <span class="redacted">lie</span> with impunity, fact-finding becomes impossible. If agencies can't compel truthfulness, their investigations become exercises in competing storytelling rather than genuine inquiries into what happened.</p>

          <p>And workers lose faith in the system. They see others file complaints that go nowhere. They see companies continue the same practices despite multiple findings against them. They conclude—often correctly—that the complaint process is more about managing liability than ensuring fairness.</p>

          <p>This is how oversight dies. Not through dramatic failure, but through quiet erosion. Systems that lack enforcement power become rituals. Forms get filled out. Findings get issued. But nothing actually changes.</p>

          <p>The institutions that are supposed to be held accountable learn to game the process. They hire lawyers who specialize in crafting position statements that minimize risk while maximizing defensibility. They develop template responses that sound reasonable without necessarily being truthful. They count on agencies' limited resources and complainants' limited stamina.</p>

          <p>And it works. The companies continue operating exactly as they did before. The workers who filed complaints either give up or move on. The oversight agencies process the next batch of cases with the same structural limitations.</p>

          <p>The appearance of accountability persists. The reality does not.</p>

          <h3>The Choice That Isn't One</h3>

          <p>I filed my complaint knowing the limitations. I understood that PPG's position statement would be carefully crafted to minimize their liability. I expected them to present their most favorable narrative.</p>

          <p>What surprised me was the brazenness. Not evasion or spin or strategic framing, but outright denial of easily-verified facts. A position statement that directly contradicted documentation I could provide.</p>

          <p>And when I submitted my rebuttal with evidence of the misrepresentation, nothing happened. The investigation continued. The false claim remained part of their official statement. No consequences. No corrections. Just the understanding that this is how the game is played.</p>

          <p>So what do you do? You can decline to participate in complaint processes, accepting that you have no recourse. Or you can participate, knowing that the system is structurally tilted against you and that even demonstrable dishonesty from respondents carries no penalty.</p>

          <p>Neither option feels like a choice. Both lead to the same place: the company faces no accountability, the dysfunction continues, and the next worker encounters the same problems you did.</p>

          <p>The only thing you control is whether you document what happened. Whether you create a record, even if that record leads nowhere. Whether you tell the truth, even in a system that doesn't require truth from the powerful.</p>

          <p>Maybe that matters. Maybe future workers will find these records and learn what they're walking into. Maybe patterns will become visible if enough people document them.</p>

          <p>Or maybe it's just documentation for its own sake—the record of what happened, preserved against the narrative that it never did.</p>
