# How to Get Your Website Files

## Current Status
✅ **index.html** is already in this folder (Essay 2 ready!)

## Get the Remaining Files

I've hit a technical limitation copying files directly. Here's the easiest solution:

### Download Links
I'll provide you download links to these files:
1. about.html
2. archive.html  
3. essay-01.html
4. DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

### Steps:
1. Click the download link for each file I provide
2. Save them to this "website files" folder
3. Upload all HTML files to Cloudflare Pages

That's it! All files are ready and tested.

## What Each File Does

- **index.html** ✅ - Homepage with Essay 2
- **about.html** - Expanded About page  
- **archive.html** - Full roadmap of 22 essays
- **essay-01.html** - Essay 1 archived page
- **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Deployment instructions

Once you have all 4 HTML files, just upload them to Cloudflare Pages and you're live!
