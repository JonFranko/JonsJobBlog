# Website Files for Jon's Job Blog

## Files Successfully Created

I've created all the website files you need for publishing Essay 2. Here's what I've done:

### ✅ Completed:
1. **index.html** - Already in this folder! Features Essay 2: "When Corporate Values Become Marketing"

### 📥 Still Need to Copy:
The following files are ready in my outputs folder and need to be copied to this directory:

2. **about.html** - Expanded About page with project context
3. **archive.html** - Complete roadmap of all 22 essays  
4. **essay-01.html** - Essay 1 with its own permanent URL
5. **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Detailed deployment instructions

## How to Get the Remaining Files

Since I hit a technical limitation copying files between our computers, you have two options:

### Option 1: Download from Outputs
I've placed all files in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` on my computer. You can:
1. Ask me to show you the content of each file
2. Copy/paste them into new files in this directory

### Option 2: I Can Recreate Them
Just ask me to "create about.html in the website files folder" and I'll write each file directly to your local directory one at a time.

## What index.html Contains

The index.html file already in this folder features:
- Essay 2: "When Corporate Values Become Marketing" (The 100-Point Paradox)
- Updated marquee banner (Dec 1, 2025)
- Full essay content from Jira DCM-29
- Visitor counter code (preserved from original)
- Links to archive and about pages
- Your existing design aesthetic

## Next Steps

1. Get the remaining 4 files into this folder
2. Upload all 5 HTML files to your Cloudflare Pages site
3. Your site will be live with Essay 2!
