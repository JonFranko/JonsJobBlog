## Key Themes in Essay 4

This essay builds nicely on the previous three, completing Part I's systemic critique:

1. **Connects to Essay 1 (Culture Fit)**: Shows how "culture fit" becomes a weapon when ownership is rhetorical
2. **Connects to Essay 2 (Values as Marketing)**: Demonstrates another gap between stated values and lived experience
3. **Connects to Essay 3 (Efficiency)**: Links cost-cutting decisions to power dynamics and trust breakdowns
4. **Sets up Part II**: The personal costs described here (canceled meetings, public criticism, language barriers) preview the emotional labor themes coming in Part II

The essay uses Amy Edmondson's psychological safety research and Gallup's workplace engagement data to support your experiential narrative, maintaining the analytical rigor that distinguishes your series.
